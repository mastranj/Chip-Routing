# Python Chart

This is a utility project provided to show how the python graphs were generated.
There is not a built in support to build/execute grapher.py, but if interested
in running, you should install python and be sure to `pip install` scipy,
and numpy.

To run, simply execute it with a python command, e.g.:
`python3 grapher.py <True/False>`. The `<True/False>` argument is to toggle
showing/hiding the optimal line. Set it to false to see the full chart and
without the optimal speedup line.
